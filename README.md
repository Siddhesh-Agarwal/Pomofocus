This is my first ReactJS project about cloning an Pomodoro website (at URL: https://pomofocus.io/), i also changed a little bit of function in that website to suitable for my personal using purpose.
Please tell me if it has any bugs at my email address: narutoducphuong76@gmail.com.
I commit this cloned website only use for personal purpose, not commercial.
Thanks a lot, enjoy and have fun!

\*Note:

- in src/index.js, not include React.StrictMode
- this is my first project with React so state management is really bad :DDD
- this is none responsive wweb
